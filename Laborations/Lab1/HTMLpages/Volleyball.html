        <section><h3><mark>Volleyball</mark></h3><p><mark>Volleyball</mark> is a team sport in which two teams of <strong>six players</strong> are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964. The sport is a <strong>fun</strong> excercise to perfom on the cold winterdays when you can't be outside and play </p></section>
        <section><h3>Jump!</h3><p>Leg Plyometrics Exercises are going to be a huge asset to your volleyball training plan. Doing the exercises regularly can help you gain the vertical jump to be a better blocker and hitter, and can also make you a better defensive player because you will have the speed and agility to cover more of the court. If you want to not only make the team, but be a starter for the team, this routine can help you increase your chances for both. </p></section>
