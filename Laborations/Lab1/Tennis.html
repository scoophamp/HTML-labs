        <section><h3><mark>Tennis</mark> the sport to play</h3><p>There are many different kinds of courts, like grass, clay, or a sand. The goal of tennis is to hit the ball over the net into the other player’s court. When the other player cannot return the ball, a point is won. The game is played with two or four people. When it is played with two people, it is called “singles”, and when it is played with four people, it is called “doubles”. The court has alleys on each side, which are fair territory when playing doubles. </p></section>
        <section><h3>Better when weather is hot</h3><p><mark>Tennis</mark> is a racket sport that can be <strong>played</strong> individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two <em>players each</em> (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. </p></section>
